# Animals App

Animals app, using a search bar with functional components and react-router-dom demonstrating routes and switches. Please note that this technology is used in this may differ from more recent examples due to the changes with react-router-dom. A new app will be created soon that will demonstrate the new methods.

The animal types are populated from a JSON file and then a search using unsplash is used to get random images matching that string into the application.

**NB:** - All images are sourced from unsplash and sometimes they do not directly match the animal name.
